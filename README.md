📧 Spam Email Detection using Scikit-learn
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify emails or messages as Spam or Not Spam. It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and a Naive Bayes classifier to perform binary classification.

🎯 Objective

To create a supervised machine learning model

To classify text messages as Spam or Not Spam

To evaluate the model using standard performance metrics
🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Type: Supervised Learning

Problem: Binary Classification

Algorithm Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorization

🧾 Dataset

A sample dataset of text messages is used where:

message → email/text content (feature)

label → classification

1 = Spam

0 = Not Spam

Example:

Message Label Win free money now Spam Let’s meet tomorrow Not Spam ⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook
🚀 Steps Implemented

Imported required libraries

Created a labeled dataset

Split data into training and testing sets

Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trained a Naive Bayes classifier

Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy score

Classification report

Tested the model with new input messages
📊 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

These metrics help measure the effectiveness of the spam detection system.
🧪 Sample Prediction

predict_spam("You have won a free gift")
Output: SPAM
✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to text classification problems like spam detection. Using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes provides a simple yet effective approach for handling text-based data.
🔮 Future Improvements

Use a real-world dataset (e.g., Kaggle spam dataset)

Try other classifiers like Logistic Regression or SVM

Add a confusion matrix visualization

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
